# phitter
phitter is an open-source python package to simulate and fit to data observables from stellar binary systems. At this time, observables that can be generated and fit with phitter include photometry (i.e., observed fluxes) and line-of-sight radial velocities (RVs).

Observables that can be modeled and fit to observations include:

* Photometry (default set: $K'$- and $H$-bands with the Keck II NIRC2 imager).
* Radial velocities of both primary and secondary star.



Near-term to do features:

* Allow flexible combinations of photometric filters for fitting observables.
