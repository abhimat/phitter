# Tutorials

Some basic tutorials to understand how to use Phitter's main features.

## [Simulate a model binary](notebooks/simulate_model_binary)

This tutorial walks through the basics of setting up a simulation of a model binary system, with models of observable fluxes and RVs.

## [Simulate a model binary using stellar parameters from an isochrone](notebooks/simulate_model_binary_wMIST_star_params)

This tutorial introduces how to use Phitter to specify stellar parameters for binary components from MIST isochrones. Constraining stellar parameters to those derived from isochrones can be useful if the age of a binary or the host star population is well constrained.

## Including additional effects on photometric fluxes

***(Under construction)*** In order to match observables to data, additional photometric effects can be included. Examples include reddening from extinction, distance modulus, or flux zero-point uncertainties.

## Including additional effects on radial velocities

***(Under construction)*** Similar to photometric data, additional effects can be included on radial velocities (RVs) simulated from Phitter. Currently this only includes a constant offset for the system's center of mass.

## Advanced: how to incorporate new photometric passbands into Phitter

***(Under construction)*** 

## Fitting simulations to observed data using nested sampling
